🚀 **Ever wondered why some applications feel lightning-fast while others struggle to load? The secret weapon is almost always Caching.** ⚡

I've just published/updated "**Caching — The Ultimate System Design Guide**" 📖

Whether you're preparing for System Design interviews or building highly scalable applications, understanding caching inside out is non-negotiable. 

Here is what I cover in this comprehensive guide:
✅ **The Tea Analogy** - A simple way to understand why caching matters
✅ **Multi-layer Caching** - From Browser and CDN to Application and DB
✅ **Caching Strategies** - Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Back, and Write-Around
✅ **Cache Eviction Policies** - LRU, LFU, FIFO, and when to use which
✅ **Distributed Caching & Consistent Hashing** - Scaling the cache across multiple nodes

Caching is so much more than just throwing Redis into your stack. It's about designing a system that guarantees consistency, maximizes hit rates, and minimizes database load. 📉
